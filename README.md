So i am creating a webshop in java that works like this and i'm pretty new at this thing so i need help:

I have a JSON formatted file in which i have items in them with specific parameters which would be read and the item parameters would be extracted and shown and displayed on the webpage.

i have an admin that can access the admin page through the action "/admin" which can edit and delete 
there's a mechanism for sorting and searching and multiple buttons that are dedicated on the specific parameter "kategorie" and through that identifier it leads to a page with only items with that "kategorie"

for the normal user we use the action "/start" which starts up the page.

i am encountering problems on the reading of the files help would be appreciated
